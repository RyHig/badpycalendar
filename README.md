# Bad tkinter calendar
Just a small script to make a simple html calendar... 
Currently just using to run a gui calendar from i3blocks. 
A few options online suggested the following
- [pyhtmlgui](https://pypi.org/project/pyhtmlgui/)
- [pywebview](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview)
- [nicegui](https://nicegui.io)
- ...and many [more](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming)

I ended up just trying [tkhtmlview](https://pypi.org/project/tkhtmlview/)... I'll probably regret it, but this is just a quick and dirty test.

## TODOs:
- [ ] figure out how to draw the window appropriately.
- [ ] find out how to always create the correct window size. 
Seems a bit less trivial than I initially thought.
- [ ] highlight current day of the week. 
- [ ] integrate iCal?
- [ ] css stuff (dark mode, etc.)
